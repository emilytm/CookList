# CookList

Cook List is a recipe search and saving app that I created as the solo project for the 'Working with APIs' module of the Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path. We were tasked with building a movie watchlist app and I used Edamam's Recipe Search API to make it something I would be likely to use myself and keep improving on. This was my first self-directed API project (rather than following a spec).

**Next steps:** Store saved recipes in a more robust way, integrate the search and save functionality with the RecipeFinder project, allow for more categorization, tagging, and note taking on individual recipes.

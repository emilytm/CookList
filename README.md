# CookList

This app started as part of the 'Working with APIs' module in Scrimba's Front-end Developer Career Path. We were tasked with building a responsive web app that made use of a REST API and I decided to build an app for keeping track of recipes. I plan to turn this into a functional app for my own use and to share with friends at some point in the future, and to incorporate the related work I did in RecipeFinder to make it a more complete tool.
